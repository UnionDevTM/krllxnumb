This spiritual period encourages you to let yourself be led by the Universe and dream big.Especially since you’ll have plenty of time for windfalls when Saturn in Pisces sextiles Uranus in your sign on Friday. There’s a strong possibility of sudden gains and wishes coming true as you’re able to go your own way in life.You end the week on a social note when Venus in Pisces trines Mars in Cancer on Sunday. This is a great day to hang out with friends and talk about life. Whether the group chat is spilling tea or getting together for Sunday brunch, this is an ideal time to connect and share big ideas.",
